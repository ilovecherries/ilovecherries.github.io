i'm currently exploring MINIX and OS development and i need a room to put my thoughts notes whatever the fuck

# main resources
## books
- explains OS design using minix as example - [Operating Systems - Design and Implementation](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Operating%20Systems.%20Design%20and%20Implementation.pdf)
- i think this is more generic modern OS introspection but still looks good - [Modern Operating Systems](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf)

## websites
### osdev
- bootstrapping a minimal kernel - <https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones>
- setting up a cross compiler - <https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler>

# OSes to study
## MINIX
Microkernel written in C that separates kernel functionality into processes and sends messages between different layers of the OS.
---
repo: <https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix>
- The companion book, [Operating Systems -  Design and Implementation](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Operating%20Systems.%20Design%20and%20Implementation.pdf), is recommended reading.
  - If you want to follow along with the book, switch to tag `v3.1.0`, but the latest release is much easier to rebuild and is compatible with more modern software to use as a base. It definitely beats looking at the source code in the book.
- Follow the instructions here to compile: <https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:crosscompiling>
- Patches to apply to MINIX master branch so it compiles with gcc-10+: <https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix/pull/322>
- Fork of MINIX that compiles on M1 macOS using Docker: <https://github.com/lincdog/minix>

### Compiling without rebuilding the whole system
I'm pretty sure that this actually doesn't even work...
```sh
alias minix-nbmake=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/../obj.i386/tooldir.xyz/bin/nbmake-i386
alias minix-img=CREATE_IMAGE_ONLY=1 $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/releasetools/x86_cdimage.sh
# do this inside of the directory you want to recompile, they usually have a Makefile to recompile
minix-nbmake && minix-nbmake install
# create the image
minix-img
```

## Linux
Monolithic kernel written in C. I think most people know this one

- A study on the scheduler for Linux 2.6.8.1: <https://web.archive.org/web/20070627191326/http://josh.trancesoftware.com/linux/linux_cpu_scheduler.pdf>

## Serenity
OS with a monolithic kernel written in C++ with a huge monorepo of different utilities. The window system, audio, image rendering, are all seperated into different 'process servers.' This description is most likely incorrect and begs for revision.

repo: <https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity>
- The creator's YouTube channel, really informative and entertaining for something to watch when bored: <https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos>
  - I recommend sorting by oldest to see base parts being developed
  - I also recommend looking for videos with the title of *Code Tour* but some of the older implementation videos are also interesting

# notes
## TODO: scheduling

## notes for cross compilation with clang / llvm
this assumes that you have a base from the [OSdev Bare Bones OS](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones). i just do this because clang is more convenient to use on macOS
- CFLAGS for clang: `--target=i686-elf -march=i686 -nostdlib -fno-builtin -ffreestanding`
```
clang --target=i686-elf -march=i686 -nostdlib -fno-builtin -ffreestanding -c kernel.c -o kernel.o
```
- remove `BLOCK` from linker.ld, `ALIGN` performs basically the same with the LLVM linker. also don't remove the `:`s from the file
- invoke the LLVM linker like so:
```
ld.lld -T path-to-linker.ld -o output.bin list-of-object-files.o
```
if this needs better explanation, please advise
