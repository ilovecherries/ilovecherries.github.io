## discord-qcs-bridge
<https://github.com/ilovecherries/discord-qcs-bridge>

Discord-QCS-Bridge is a Discord-ContentAPI chat bridge that allows users from both platforms to communicate with one another. The naming of **QCS** refers to the "official" instance of ContentAPI.

## sb-inputredirection
<https://github.com/ilovecherries/sb-inputredirection>

This uses the InputRedirection feature in the Luma3DS CFW to provide an interface from your PC to SmileBASIC.

This has the base groundwork for what could be done, but there are a lot of binds missing. It can easily be extended upon at this point though and can be used as an example for how InputRedirection is done.

## chip8
- C++ implementation <https://github.com/ilovecherries/chip8>
- Nim implementation: <https://github.com/ilovecherries/chip8-nim>
  - Online Demo: <https://ansxor.github.io/c8/chip8.html>

A collection of different CHIP-8 interpreters I've made. I made the Nim implementation first as the "fun" way to make the CHIP-8 interpreter and as a way to learn Nim, and then I made the C++ implementation later on so that I could implement a CHIP-8 interpreter into [SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org).

## contentapi-objectionlol
<https://github.com/ilovecherries/contentapi-objectionlol>

<https://ilovecherries.github.io/contentapi-objectionlol/>

This retrieves chat logs stored on a ContentAPI instance and converts them into a format readable for [Objection.lol](https://objection.lol). There are also some helpers included that help set metadata like the avatar that certain users portray.

## contentapi-ts-bindings
<https://github.com/ilovecherries/contentapi-ts-bindings>

A collection of bindings to ContentAPI that can be used from TypeScript in either the browser or from Node.js. I've used this for all my ContentAPI related projects.
